# clnkr-3d-print-case
HI, this is my first Upload on github i hope you enjoy my new designed Case for the Clunker "Typing Angle is 6 degree"

To assemble the case you need:

- 2 pieces hexagon socket screw M3x8 or 10mm (see picture)

- 4 pieces M2x4mm screws for the plate (you can just use the standard m2 screws that come with the Stabilizer.)

- 3 pieces countersunk screw M3x4 or 5mm (see picture)

- 3 pieces of weights (width: 40mm length: 50mm height: 3mm) with a M3 thread in the middle. 
Which material you use is up to you. 
You can buy them on ebay or something like that, or you can make them yourself.

- 4 pieces rubber feet, max. 12 diameter

The holes in the top case have the respective core hole diameters for the screws. 
By screwing in the screws, the thread is turned.
I recommend doing this carefully so that the screws do not overtighten or break the hole instead.


If the thread no longer lifts, for example due to wear, 
you can buy threaded sleeves on Amazon or ebay and carefully insert them with the help of a soldering iron. 
Before doing this, I recommend drilling out the holes to the approximate diameter of the threaded sleeve.

- You have two different tops to choose from, see Imgur link: https://imgur.com/a/sQDrGmc

the Top-Clnkr, the lettering goes through the top.

the Top-Clnkr_Letters you can have the lettering printed in a colour of your choice. You will need the letters stl file for this.

- For the plates, stl and dxf are available. I have created a plate for each bottom row.
- If your are not able to get a weight, i have weight stl. to fit the sapce until you get a weight of your choice.
